# National Park Geek

This was created as a module capstone project while I was a student at Tech Elevator. 

The website utilizes C#, ASP.NET MVC, HTML, CSS, and SQL. 

You can view the site live at http://nationalparkgeek-2.apphb.com/. 

If you would like to view the project locally, there is a schema included to construct your database.
